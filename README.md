# Using Machine Learning and Proteomics Data for earlier Brain Cancer detection

## Motivation
Brain cancer affects thousands of individuals worldwide each year. To improve the patients outcome, it is important to determine the type, grade and size of the tumor in the early stage. Conventional diagnosis methods such as MRI and CT can visualize brain abnormalities, however these methods are time and cost expensive and can't distinguish between the two main types of brain cancer (Oligodendroglioma and Astrocytoma). By using a proteomics approach, molecular patterns can be investigated to distinguish between the two tumor types in earlier brain cancer state. Investigation of proteomics data of ~ 300 patients suffering from Oligodendroglioma and Astroglioma revealed 17 proteins that differ significantly in expression patterns between the two cancer types. Based on these 17 proteins, we used a machine learning apporach to predict the cancer type of patients based on proteomics data.
